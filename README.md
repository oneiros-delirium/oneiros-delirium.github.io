TODO: Convert the following to issues

1. Fit background nightsky.jpg to show entire dialogue
2. Change font style of website header to match the rest of the page
3. Each article "box" extends as per content in them. Need to make them uniform.
4. Remove numbering / configure slider of the landing page (& arrows)

Ongoing: Comment out unnecessary code
